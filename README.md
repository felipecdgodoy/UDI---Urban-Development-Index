# UDI---Urban-Development-Index
The Urban Development Index (UDI), originally "Indice de Desenvolvimento Urbano - IDU", is a socioeconomic index development by myself and Rodrigo Saldanha de Matos David to measure the quality of life an urban center provides to its residents. The index uses key factors related to health, education, and access to basic services, which were determined after extensive research in partnership with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)
